This poem is for you
<br>
<br>
<br>
How many nights
<br>
It would take?
<br>
To count the stars,
<br>
But I would spend
<br>
Every night,
<br>
For the rest of my life
<br>
Counting stars
<br>
Until I found you,
<br>
For every star
<br>
I counted,
<br>
I would give a reason
<br>
Why I like you,
<br>
There probably aren't
<br>
Enough stars in the sky,
<br>
Because my love
<br>
Stretches across
<br>
The endless entity
<br>
And beyond,
<br>
You'll find me
<br>
Under the black velvet sky,
<br>
Every night
<br>
Faithful to a fault,
<br>
Counting those stars
<br>
Until I find you..</p>

   <p style="color: white">Well I used to believe that love couldn't be made at first sight. But yet now today I do think it happens,This is going to sound crazy, but  from the moment I first set eyes on you I haven't able to stop thinking of you, It's crazy right how much one person can affect you</p>
